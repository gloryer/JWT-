# jsonwebtoken
A demo back end server exposes user registration endpoint, user authentication endpoint, token endpoint and resource endpoint. The resource endpoint is protected by the JWT token. Only the client who possesses the valid token can access the resource. To get a token from the server, the client must authenticates itself to the server. To request the resource in the server, the client issue an http GET request to the resource endpoint, the server will verify the recieved jwt token. Once the token is valid, the server will send back the user information which indicated in the jwt token.  Front-end has not been implemented so far. The back-end is tested using Postman.
